# Fund Analysis Input Contract

This reference describes host-provided payloads for runtime skill ID
`fund_analysis`. The host owns data fetching and must pass JSON-serializable
data in `SkillInput.payload`.

## Minimal Structured Payload

```json
{
  "portfolio": {
    "as_of_date": "2026-06-01",
    "total_value": 200000,
    "cash_available": 20000,
    "positions": [
      {
        "fund_code": "110011",
        "fund_name": "Example Fund",
        "current_value": 30000,
        "total_cost": 32000,
        "shares": 12345.67,
        "target_weight": 0.12,
        "tags": ["healthcare", "active"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "risk_profile": {
    "risk_level": "moderate",
    "max_single_fund_weight": 0.2,
    "max_theme_weight": 0.35,

    "short_term_trade_budget_pct": 0.1
  },
  "constraints": {
    "min_trade_amount": 100,
    "forbidden_actions": []
  }
}
```

## Expanded Payload

```json
{
  "portfolio": {},
  "fund_profiles": {
    "110011": {
      "fund_code": "110011",
      "name": "Example Fund",
      "fund_type": "equity",
      "manager": "Manager",
      "benchmark": "Benchmark"
    }
  },
  "nav_history": {
    "110011": [
      {"date": "2025-06-01", "nav": 1.0},
      {"date": "2026-06-01", "nav": 1.2}
    ]
  },
  "holdings": {
    "110011": [
      {"name": "A", "weight": 0.08, "industry": "technology", "region": "CN"}
    ]
  },
  "transactions": [],
  "dca_plans": {},
  "market_scenario": {
    "name": "host_supplied_drawdown",
    "risk_level": "high",
    "description": "Host-provided scenario text"
  },
  "risk_profile": {},
  "constraints": {}
}
```

## Transaction Event Semantics

Each transaction event in the host-provided ledger must carry an `action`
(or `type` alias) drawn from: `BUY`, `SELL`, `DIVIDEND`, `FEE`,
`TRANSFER_IN`, `TRANSFER_OUT`, `CALIBRATE`.

| Action | Shares | Cost basis | Cashflow / Realized PnL |
|--------|--------|------------|--------------------------|
| BUY | += shares (or amount/nav) | += amount | Cash outflow |
| SELL | -= shares (or amount/nav) | -= pro-rata cost | Cash inflow; realized PnL = amount - cost_of_sold |
| DIVIDEND | Unchanged | Unchanged | +amount as realized income |
| FEE | Unchanged | Unchanged | -amount as realized expense |
| TRANSFER_IN | += shares (or amount/nav) | += amount | Position movement only; NOT cash flow |
| TRANSFER_OUT | -= shares (or amount/nav) | -= pro-rata cost | Position movement only; NO realized PnL |
| CALIBRATE | Overwritten | Overwritten | No cashflow; warns it overrides ledger state |

**Policy notes:**
- Weighted-average cost basis is used (not FIFO/LIFO).
- Dividend reinvestment must be expressed as `DIVIDEND + BUY`.
- Fees do NOT capitalize into cost basis.
- TRANSFER_OUT has no realized PnL; use SELL if realized PnL is needed.
- SELL beyond shares is clamped and warned; shares never go negative.
- BUY/SELL with amount only (no shares, no nav) is marked unresolved.
- CALIBRATE resets position state and realized PnL.

- `portfolio.positions[].target_weight` enables `suggested_rebalance_plan`.
- `transactions` enables transaction ledger, cost basis, reconciliation, and
  short-term budget usage.
- `dca_plans` enables DCA review.
- `holdings` improves theme, industry, and region exposure.
- `market_scenario` must be supplied by the host and must not be invented by
  `fund-agent`.

## Derived Portfolio Mode

When `portfolio.positions` is not available, the host may provide:

```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {"action": "BUY", "fund_code": "110011", "date": "2025-06-01", "amount": 10000.00, "shares": 10000.00, "nav": 1.00}
  ],
  "current_nav": {"110011": 1.20},
  "as_of_date": "2026-06-01",
  "risk_profile": {},
  "constraints": {}
}
```

`fund_analysis` will deterministically build a position snapshot from the
transaction ledger using weighted-average cost basis. The derived snapshot is
emitted as `derived_portfolio_snapshot` artifact along with
`ledger_cashflow_summary`.

## Reconciliation Mode

When both host `portfolio.positions` and `transactions` + `current_nav` exist,
`fund_analysis` runs a ledger-portfolio reconciliation and emits
`ledger_reconciliation_report` listing mismatches.

## Research Query Planning

When `payload.research_planning` is `true`, `fund_analysis` produces a
`research_query_plan` artifact with suggested news and sentiment queries.
This is a plan only — the host decides whether to call `news_research` or
`sentiment_analysis`. No network calls are made.

## Optional Data Fields

The following host-owned data fields are accepted and passed through:

- `benchmarks` — fund benchmark identifiers
- `benchmark_history` — benchmark return history
- `peer_group` — peer fund comparison data
- `factor_exposures` — factor exposure data
- `manager_profiles` — fund manager information
- `fee_schedules` — fund fee structures
- `redemption_rules` — redemption/settlement rules

All are host-provided pass-through; `fund-agent` does not fetch them.

## Compatibility Fallback

Payloads with only `related_entities` can produce baseline HardEvidence for
legacy callers. Hosts should prefer structured portfolio payloads for reports.
